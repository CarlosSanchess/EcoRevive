# EcoRevive Project Changelog

## Sprint #1

### Overview
At the conclusion of Sprint #1, we successfully followed the priority defined in the sprint backlog, ensuring that tasks were completed in alignment with their designated importance. By following this prioritization, we effectively tackled essential user stories, such as enabling user registration and login, adding new recyclable products, and providing profile customization options. However, as we transition into Sprint #2, we recognize the need to enhance our development process. To achieve this, we aim to intensify our focus on unit testing throughout the software development lifecycle. By incorporating rigorous testing procedures, we aspire to identify and address potential issues early on, ensuring the delivery of a more robust and reliable product. Additionally, we intend to improve our integration practices by merging divergent features into the product more frequently. This approach will allow us to detect and rectify any bugs or inconsistencies promptly, fostering a smoother and more cohesive development cycle. We are also looking forward to integrating each individual feature into the whole product more often in order to find conflicting bugs.

In this Sprint #1 our backlog tasks rely on some new technologies that we had to implement to deliver a good product.

### These include:
- Implementation of our DataBase the Firestore Database.
- Implementation of our CloudStorage the Firebase Storage, that makes possible the storage of our Product Images and Profile Pictures.Both can be mapped easily.
- Utilizing Device Local Storage to store user preferences, such as the chosen app theme and device login status.
- Enabling access to the device gallery for uploading photos within the app.
- Utilizing e-mail sending technoly to Change Password, in a safe way.
